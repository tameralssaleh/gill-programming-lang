define x[3] int [1, 2, 3]

try {
    out x[5] ; This line will not work as the index is out of range, thus will execute the catch block. 
} catch {
    out "Error"
} finally {
    out "Code finished." ; this will execute no matter if there is an error or if the try block executed without an error.
}
